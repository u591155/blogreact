            <h3>The Effect On Everyone</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>One of the most debatable topics that makes people have mix emotions is politics. Careful! For some people it can drive them up the wall, 
            but one thing that must be said before anything else (and I hope must of you can agree) is that politics effects everyone. 
            Whether is because of implementation or the lack of regulations politics gets nearly everywhere. </p>
            <p>One thing is for sure, 2020 has given a lot to debate about in terms of this topic. I would like to bring forward two definitions. First, 
            politics is defined as the art or science of government that is concerned with winning and holding control over a government, the total complex relationship between people living in society. 
            Second, common sense is defined as sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perfection of the situation or facts. With that said lets be honest here, nobody knows exactly what is going on, 
            but it seems like a total mess. The pandemic keeps getting worse and the regulations do not seem to be following along.</p>
            <p>There are multiple reasons that can be pointed out as far as why things do not seem to be working and why people are not being helped like they should be, but a whole book can be written about 
            that (and I am sure it will in a few years) and that is not the focus of this piece. The one thing that needs to be pointed out is that with things happening so fast regulations are hard to catch 
            up in a nation that is so large and so many perspectives of how things should be done. To change things a lot of things need to be taken into account so others things do not get broken. </p>    
            <p>The most important for now is making sure that people stay healthy and safe during this pandemic, but it seems like some of the regulations in place are reactive instead of proactive. 
            Different perspectives even challenge the idea of wearing masks! For so of us it might seem like common sense, but for others its seems to be a violation of their freedom. How can society be split 
            into these two perspective? Simple, it is a matter of opinion. At the end of the day the regulations are in place, but some people are willing to challenge that idea, and that is the whole point of politics. </p>    
            <p>With that controversial couple of lines the one thing that we should remember is that politics have set up a couple of rules, but it is up to the people to enforce them. Practice common sense and keep your six 
            feet distance, wash your hands and wear your mask. Many people argue that they are not in the category of the people that if infected would not face life threatening complications or symptoms at all, but just remember that we are doing it for those that would. As part of society we need to take care of each other and that starts with common sense regardless of politics.    </p>
