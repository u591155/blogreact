            <h3>Gas On Citizens</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>What if I told you that tear gas is banned in international warfare, but its use is permitted by a government against its own civilians? I first read this statement on a meme on Instagram,
            and my immediate reaction was disbelief; how did that statement make any sense? After doing some research, I came to a surprising conclusion: the Instagram meme was right. With the increased 
            use of tear gas in recent months against protestors across the country, it’s important to have a better understanding of the legality and reasoning behind its use. Whatever “side” you stand on,
            it’s important to know what our government is allowed to use against its own people.</p> 
            <p>Rather than one, singular compound, “tear gas” is a blanket term for chemicals used by forces to disperse crowds. It is a type of “riot control agent” meant to make people “unable to function by causing irritation to eyes, 
            mouth, throat, lungs, skin”, as quoted from the CDC website. Tear gas is often made of multiple chemical compounds, with the most common ones being chloroacetophenone (CN) and chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS), chloropicrin 
            (PS), bromobenzylcyanide (CA), dibenzoxazepine (CR). When used in crowds, it’s typically a powder or solid form that’s mixed with liquids or gas for dispersal use. Often times, it’s difficult to know what kind of chemicals are 
            used, as there aren’t uniform and consistent regulations regarding what chemical agents, both individually or as a combination, may be used.</p>

            there aren’t uniform and consistent regulations regarding what chemical agents, both individually or as a combination, may be used.</p>
            <p>Tear gas attaches easily to clothes and skin when it makes contact. Effects include teary eyes, inflammation, burning and blurry vision, skin redness and rashes, chemical burns. Inhaling the substances causes violent coughing, 
            crying, and mucus production. Its effects are worse for the young, the old, and people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory issues. The use of tear gas is particularly dangerous now because of the prevalence of COVID-19, whose
            effects are exacerbated by harm to the respiratory system. If exposed, most people’s symptoms subside, but the use of chemical irritants have been increasing and long-term effects are still a bit hazy.</p>
            <p>Tear gas first showed up in WWI, but the main components of the widely used CS were synthesized by two American chemists in 1928. The main controlling regulator chemical weapon use is the Organization for
            Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is the implementing body of The Chemical Weapons Convention. This convention took effect in 1997 and banned the use of chemical weapons in warfare. However, Article II.9.d provided an 
            exception to this ban by allowing the use of tear gas for domestic riot control purposes by domestic law enforcement. As a whole, the convention banned tear gas from warfare but allowed its use against domestic populations as a 
            “less than lethal” weapon, as long as its purpose was for crowd control.</p>
            <p>Countries recognized the indiscriminate effects tear gas would have on armies, but preserved the right to use it against domestic populations as a means of avoiding lethal means of crowd control. If it’s classified as a riot
            control agent, it’s exempt from the ban on chemical weapons. Its use in war is considered offensive, which is not permitted, but its use domestically is permitted because it’s considered defensive under the guise of protecting the 
            public as a whole. The chemical components of teargas have largely stayed the same, but its means of dispersal have varied. Modernly, tear gas is dispersed in a variety of ways, such as through projectiles, cannisters splitting into
            parts so it’s harder to throw back, launching canisters that bounce, or in the form of aerosols that look like fire extinguishers.</p> 
            <p>Now that the technicalities and brief history lesson is done, we wonder how and when are forces allowed to use it? The concerning, short answer is that we don’t really know. There is no solid, clear, universal standard. Its use
            depends on local protocols, as there are no wide-spread, clear, and consistent regulations on exactly when forces can or can’t use it. The United Nations has laid out a principle baseline, which states that there must be a threat that 
            the police can’t contain without the use of a less than lethal weapon (here would be teargas). If the police feel like there’s a threat or danger, they must first give a verbal warning, then wait some time for people to actually leave.
            Only then may they fire tear gas into a crowd, but it must be at a distance so the police don’t risk hitting civilians with a canister or getting the tear gas so close to civilians that they might inhale a large dose. The wind must also
            be in the right direction, and the police need to make sure there are multiple clear exit paths for people to get away from it. Anyone injured would receive medical care and not be arrested. However, these general guidelines are often not
            followed as precisely as they should be.</p>
            <p>People in the policy world are advocating for change because the use of tear gas is too subjective, and in the midst of high-tension situations, mistakes can easily be made. Police precincts typically have their own policies and rules,
            as there is no legally enforced wide-scale regulation. Policy reform advocates would like to see clear definitions of what kinds of chemicals can be put in the formulas, what kinds of launchers may be used, and when forces can actually use them. 
            Clearer rules would lead to better accountability of those who misuse tear gas because it would make it easier to determine when the guidelines are not being followed.</p>
            <p>The legal effects of the increased use of tear gas will likely lead to additional lawsuits regarding excessive use of forces while people exercise their first amendment rights to free speech and public assembly. Although this is a whole issue
            in itself, it’s important to note because law is not as clear-cut or simply as we may think it is; there is a lot of grey area. People have a right to protest and exercise their free speech, but police forces also have an interest in keeping the
            public safe. When the ambiguous rules surrounding the use of nonlethal weapons gives forces the discretionary ability to make subjective decisions, the lines between legal and illegal blur. If police can deploy tear gas when they feel threatened 
            and under the guise of “public safety”, it’s a subjective test that’s hard to penalize and hold people accountable for. Further developments in the law should be made to protect all parties involved, protesters and forces alike, and help bridge 
            the gap of mistrust between community members and police forces.</p>
