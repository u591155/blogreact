            <h3>Healthy Can Help You Fight</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>What a difference a few months can make on the whole world, the pandemic. Since late February 2020 the U.S. and the rest of the globe have been suffering the effects of Covid 19. Has there been anything this catastrophic to
            human immunity since the “Spanish Flu?” To think with how far our medical field has advanced since 1920, it’s offsetting to feel so weak in the eyes of a Virus or are we? </p>
            <p>Let’s talk about exercise and the strength of healthy diet. Before there was Corona, my country(USA) has been plagued by obesity, sedentary lifestyle, fast food consumption, and lack of the importance of health in general. 
            It seems as if us as humans have forgotten our original design as hunters and gatherers. We’re designed to be on are feet moving and eating foods that are naturally cultivated from our beautiful earth. </p>
            <p>Although most death are occurring with people over 65 years of age, nearly 4 in every ten cases are people under 55. With that being said, people who should be at the prime of their health are falling victim as well. 
            Why is that? I think it’s because we’re unhealthy as a civilization. And now more then ever it’s time to start taking charge and being creative. A healthy immune system could be your only hope in these trying times.</p>
            <hr/>    
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid eating processed foods.</li>
                <li>Drastically reduce—or eliminate—the sugar and starch in your diet.</li>
                <li>Choose plant-based, whole foods.</li>
                <li>Eat enough protein—about half your body weight in grams of protein each day.</li>
                <li>Limit or avoid alcohol.</li>
                <li>If you smoke, quit.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr/>
            
            <p>What about exercising? Well give me a second, we’re getting there. Exercise is paramount in the pursuit of super hero like  immunity. Multiple studies have now linked moderate exercise with decreased rates of influenza, pneumonia,
            and other infections, as well as chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Staying active helps boost the immune system in a variety of was like, reducing inflammation, increasing the presence of innate immune cells, 
            which positively affects your gut microbiome, and they all support your body’s defense mechanisms. </p>
            <hr/>
            Here’s a few key points:
            <ul>
                <li>Exercise is a great way to support your immune system and mental health</li>
                <li>Workouts don’t need to be long or intense to be effective</li>
                <li>Walking, cycling and running are great outdoor options if available</li>
                <li>If you can't go out, there's a vast range of home workout resources to suit every age and ability.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr/>        
            <p>You can find a variety of workout routines on YouTube, online articles, Instagram, books, magazines, or copying some Thai chi group at your local park. With gyms being locked down in California, I decided to enhance my home gym and get ahead of the curve. </p>
            <p>The options are endlessly, but your life has an expiration date. Lets make sure to follow all government health guidelines. Please, wear your masks and practice social distancing! While your at it, take a look at what you put in your body. Does this heal or hurt me? Take a look at your activity level for the week, have a I moved around a bit, exercised, and stretched my limbs? If your finding yourself answering no, then now more then ever is the time to make a change. </p>
