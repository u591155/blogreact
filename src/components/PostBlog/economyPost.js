            <h3>A Scope In Local Life</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>The amount of focus on the economy as whole is very important, so it comes to no surprise that is one of the topic heavily target by the media. 
                Business are falling, unemployment rates are high, travel industry is lags behind and uncertainty about when things will get better is a mystery. 
                We have seen economic downturns before since they always come with economic expansion (we can call it and adjustment period), but these have come due to regulatory gambling. </p>
                <p>Today we have an economy that goes down and the infection goes up. Government policy to keep the economy close to keep people save is important because people come first, 
                but these does not mean that money isnâ€™t important since it is the tool use for all trades. In a very simple economy lesson the economy is: you go to the store and you want something... 
                you check your pocket and you either can have it, or you compromise and put down what you cannot afford and take what you can afford of the things you need.</p>    
                <p>Now the media does cover the statistics of society as a whole and the way that the economy is struggling, but we are not just a number. Most people do not look a statistics and instead they look at their own condition. 
                The amount of stress that people are going through is something that it keep getting greater with the passing of time because it seems that cases keep going up. Walking down the streets you can see just how heavy the economy is being hit.</p>    
                <p>Is crazy to think that what was once a commodity like ordering take out and going to restaurants was a normal thing, but now it has become a luxury for many people. This does not effect only the merchants, but also how we feel about ourselves.
                Uncertain times needless to say and over the long horizon, the recession pushed forward by the pandemic is expected to leave lasting scars. There has been previous pandemics, but with the world being linked the way it is my educated guess is nothing like has been seen before.</p>    
                <p>One thing to point out is that the reality is tough and no clear answer can be provided as to when things will get better. The only thing we can do is stay strong and push for the government to take care of the bottom line. 
                One advise to be provided is spend on the things that you need and rely on your close people for the things you really need and cannot get. Economy also requires unity.  </p>
